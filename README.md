This is a very basic test of PostgreSQL crash recovery time.  The numbers it
spits out are the time to replay a certain number of transactions, and
optionally complete the end-of-recovery checkpoint.

Here are some numbers from a developer system.  Real life performance depends
on many factors, so of course your mileage may vary a lot, ...  The numbers
reported here are the time from redo beginning to the end-of-recovery
checkpoint completing (that is, the two numbers printed out by crash-recover.sh
added together), replaying 8 million transactions with full page writes on.
Test were run 4 times each, and avg and stddev are shown; speed-up is computed
with student's T at 95% confidence.
